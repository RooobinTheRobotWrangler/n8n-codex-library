# n8n Workflow Brain

This is a structured reference repo for building, understanding, and prompting n8n workflows with OpenAI Codex or ChatGPT.

## 📁 Folders

- `/templates/`: Reusable n8n JSON workflows (named clearly, single-purpose)
- `/prompts/`: Example prompts you can give GPT to create or edit workflows
- `/docs/`: Guides on how to structure and use this repo
- `/schema/`: Reference schema or key JSON structure documentation

## 🧠 Purpose

We’re creating a “brain” for n8n workflows so Codex or GPT can:
- Generate complete and valid JSON workflows
- Fix or explain broken workflows
- Learn patterns from working examples

## 🧪 Work in Progress

Expect ongoing updates and refactors.
